# GeniusLoci

This project is initiated by the community of Šančiai neighbourhood of Kaunas city. It is about the involvement of citizens in the development of the vision of the territory of Šančiai district.

This web site was made with love by Caro Pailhe, Naglis Jonaitis and [Bárbara Ackermann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barchuackermann/), as our first freelance job as designers and developers.
